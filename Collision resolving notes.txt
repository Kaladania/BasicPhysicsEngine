Force of restitution
- How 'springy' and obect is
- 0 = rigid
- 1 = elastic

Collision resolution
- comes after collission detection
- how an object 'reacts' to collission
- can either have them stop in place (reset position so they are constantly 'vibrating'
- or provide a propelling force opposite to gravity

- do second option and multiply by force of resistution value.


plane = -A + B + C - D


How to stop vibrations
- mark if an object is hollow/can be phased through
- if not, get the normal of the surface you'r colliding with (facing direction)
- lock the angle of that facing direction
	- e.g. if the object's normal points to the y-axis, lock that axis
	- need to know object's base normal then apply any rotation to match the orientation
